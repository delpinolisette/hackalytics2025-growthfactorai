# questions for organizers 

- what is exact form of the input? is it latituede and longitude? or is it a set of lats and longs 

# what is the difference between trip volume and trip sample 

why is the sample sometimes bigger than the trip volume 

# if it is what i think it is, where the sample is just there for confidence 

- then where is the time dimension, that volume of trips happened when? can we assume it is static for all columns?
